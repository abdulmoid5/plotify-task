# Startup Progress Tracker

Welcome to the Startup Progress Tracker README! This document provides an overview of the assessment task and the requirements for creating a simple application that documents the progress of a startup through various stages. Please read through the following sections carefully to ensure you understand the project's scope and objectives.

## Test Assignment

The primary objective of this assessment is to create a simple application that serves as a documentation tool for tracking the progress of a startup. The application will be organized into phases, each containing a set of tasks. Completing all tasks within a phase unlocks the next phase. Additionally, the application should offer the ability to reopen (undo) a task if needed.

## Getting Started

To run the application and assess your progress, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
1. **Navigate to Project Directory:** Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
1. **Install Dependencies:** Run `yarn install` to install the required dependencies.
1. **Run the Application:** Execute `yarn ios` or `yarn android` to launch the application.
1. **Interact with the App:** Use the application to track startup progress and experiment with various features.
